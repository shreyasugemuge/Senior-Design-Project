	\subsection{Yaqeen's tool research report}
	Finding ways to extract the information that we need from the data is one of the important steps toward completing the goal of this project. The two tools that I have been exploring are Tanagra and SPAD. \\
\hfill \break
SPAD is a mature data mining suite that provides powerful exploratory analyses and data mining tools, including PCA, MCA, clustering, interactive decision trees, discriminant analyses, text mining and more, all via user-friendly GUI. SPAD data mining approaches are Classification Discovery, Cluster Discovery, Regression Discovery, Association Discovery, Text Mining, Outlier Discovery, Data Visualization, Discovery Visualization, Social Network Analysis. Although SPAD is a powerful data mining software, it is a commercial licensed software that comes in French. These two points in SPAD will delay the process of extracting information. Also, the only website that we can download SPAD from is www.coheris.com, which is in French, too. In my opinion, SPAD is not the data mining software that we want to be using in this project. \\
\hfil \break
Tanagra, data mining suite, is a free software for academic and research purposes. It proposes several data mining methods from exploratory data analysis, statistical learning, machine learning and databases area. Tanagra is the successor of SIPINA which implements various supervised learning algorithms, especially an interactive and visual construction of decision trees. TANAGRA is more powerful, it contains some supervised learning but also other paradigms such as clustering, factorial analysis, parametric and nonparametric statistics, association rule, feature selection and construction algorithms. Moreover, it’s an "open source project" as every researcher can access to the source code, and add his/her own algorithms. Also, Tanagra’s main purpose is to give researchers and students an easy-to-use data mining software, conforming to the present norms of the software development in this domain (especially in the design of its GUI and the way to use it), and allowing to analyze either real or synthetic data. In the other hand, TANAGRA does not include what makes all the strength of the commercial software in this domain; a wide set of data sources, direct access to datawarehouses and databases, data cleansing, interactive utilization ..etc. The last thing, Tanagra originally comes in French as well, but we can find it in English, too. From this concept, I think using Tanagra is better than using SPAD, but I wouldn’t recommend it. \\
\hfil \break
While exploring SPAD and Tanagra, I researched rapid miner. Weka, a software that I think is helpful in data mining, which is originally in JAVA. Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from the researcher own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes. Weka is open source software issued under the GNU (General Public License). Also, one of the helpful things about Weka is that you can apply it to big data. \\
\hfill \break
In general, all the data mining softwares above are useful, but in order to choose a software that is most helpful we have to consider the main goal of the project. In my opining, from all the three data mining softwares, Weka is what I think most helpful. SPAD is powerful commercial tool that is not free nor is in English, which makes it hard to work with. Also, Tanagra doesn’t include all what a commercial software would offer which makes it less useful in our case. In conclusion, Weka what I see best from what I gathered from my research.
